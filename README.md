# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project is a sorting algorithms visualizer built with **React** and **TypeScript**.  
It provides an interactive way to explore how different sorting algorithms work step by step.

I built this project as a way to review the sorting algorithms I learned during my computer science degree.
